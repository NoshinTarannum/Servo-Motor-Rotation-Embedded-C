# Servo-Motor-Rotation-Embedded-C

## About

A servo motor needs to be rotated from 0 to 90 degrees and back to 0 degrees using two switches, Switch 1 and Switch 2, connected to an Atmega32 microcontroller.

Write and explain an embedded C program so that the servo motor rotates gradually from 0 to +90 degrees when Switch 1 is pressed, and then rotates back to 0 degrees when Switch 2 is pressed. Consider the required PWM signal has a time period of 25 ms, a minimum on-time of 1ms for the 0 degree position, and a maximum on-time of 3ms for the +90 degree position. The rotation needs to be performed gradually with a 'for/while' loop. Consider the operating frequency of ATmega32 as 16 MHz.
